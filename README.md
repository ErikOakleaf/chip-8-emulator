Another chip-8 emulator / interpreter made in C :)

If you for some reason wanted to compile this include SDL2 and SDL2 ttf lib and include folders in the src directory aswell as a font file (I used pixalated.ttf to fit the theme). The SDL2_ttf and SDL2 dlls also need to be included in the root directory.
